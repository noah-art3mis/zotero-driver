"""zel apply — execute an expanded plan through the write-ahead change log.

Ops on one object were coalesced at expansion; here they become exactly one
write. Pending log entries land before every request, so a crash never loses
the undo record — a transport failure mid-apply propagates and leaves them
pending for `zel debug reconcile`. After the writes, the touched objects are
fetched back and compared against the plan: success is verified, not assumed.
