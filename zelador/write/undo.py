"""zel undo — replay a session's change log backwards.

Only `applied` entries reverse. Before touching an object, its current state
must equal the logged new state — anything else is an undo conflict, reported
and left untouched (Zotero's server keeps no history; guessing would destroy
evidence). Coalesced entries verify against the last new and restore the first
old, mirroring apply's one-write-per-object composition. Undoing a
create_collection trashes the collection by its precomputed key, never a purge.
