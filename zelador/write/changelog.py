"""The log.v1 write-ahead change log — layer 2 of the safety model.

Append-only JSONL: a header line, then entry lines. Every operation gets a
`pending` entry (carrying its full operation record, old state included)
before the write request goes out, and a resolution line after — so a crash
mid-apply never loses the undo record. The reader folds last-status-wins.
