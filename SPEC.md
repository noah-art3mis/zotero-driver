# zelador — Specification

Repo: `zotero-driver`. Package and CLI: `zelador` / `zel` (Portuguese for "caretaker").

## What it is

A deterministic Python CLI over the Zotero Web API for reading, auditing, and reorganizing a personal Zotero library. Claude Code is the brain; the CLI is the hands. Classification and proposal-making happen in interactive Claude Code sessions; the CLI provides the safe, deterministic read/validate/apply machinery. The chat is the approval UI.

Two jobs share that machinery: a one-time **cleanup** of the existing library, and a recurring **intake** session that brings each batch of newly added items up to the same standard.

The environment it assumes: the Zotero desktop app runs on Windows, syncing continuously with zotero.org. Its data directory holds `zotero.sqlite` — the app's own local database, and therefore a full replica of the synced library — plus a `storage/` folder containing the attachment PDFs. The CLI runs under WSL on the same machine: canonical reads and all writes go to the Web API at zotero.org; the Windows-side files are reachable read-only through the `/mnt/c` mount.

Explicitly out of scope: building another citation manager, writing to Zotero's SQLite database, a standalone scheduled pipeline (may be revisited later by reusing the same CLI), realtime processing, duplicate detection UI (Zotero's own is adequate for now).

Distribution is a GitHub clone: the repo — CLI, project skills, example configs — is the install unit (`uv sync`, open Claude Code in the repo, run `/zelador-setup`); there is no published package.

## Core principle

The agent proposes; deterministic code validates; the user approves; every applied change is logged and reversible. Writes either succeed verifiably or fail loudly. Reversibility carries one honest bound: undo of trash-based operations expires when Zotero's desktop auto-empties its trash (30 days by default) — past that horizon, the backup is the restore path.

## Prototype posture

This is a prototype, not a product. Optimize for conciseness, understandability, clean architecture, and simplicity — in that spirit, not for bulletproofness. Concretely: no defensive guards against states the design already makes impossible, no retry/fallback layers beyond what the spec names (429 retry, version pins), no configurability beyond what a real session needs, no premature abstraction. Small files, pure functions, obvious names. The safety model is the one place rigor is non-negotiable — everything else should be the simplest code that reads well. When bulletproofing and simplicity conflict outside the safety model, choose simplicity.

## The author's toolchain (what this was built to serve)

The concrete tools and practices this project exists to support, and the exact seams each one drives. A fresh adopter needs none of them beyond Zotero and an agent — every seam is generic and configurable — but this list records the instance they were designed against:

- **Zotero desktop (Windows) + zotero.org sync on tablet** — the library itself; coloured tags are the working UI. Seams: Web API as canonical path; SQLite replica for `zel local`; `storage/` PDFs for fulltext; `tagColors` sync.
- **APA 7** — citation style for all writing. Seams: default `--style` for `--bib`; metadata-completeness rules calibrated per item type to APA requirements.
- **Better BibTeX + Obsidian + LaTeX** — the citekey-joined writing pipeline; the narrative and every seam it drives live in Downstream reference workflow, immediately below.
- **Claude Code** — the driving agent. Seams: `--json` NDJSON contract, project skills, bounded fulltext output, API-key redaction.
- **WSL** — where the CLI runs. Seams: `/mnt/c` read-only access to Zotero's files; the desktop local API discarded as unreachable.

## Downstream reference workflow

The concrete writing pipeline this tool is built to serve: Better BibTeX (BBT — a Zotero plugin that assigns every item a stable citation key, or citekey, and keeps `.bib` bibliography files auto-exported) exports the library into an Obsidian vault (Markdown note-taking app). Writing happens in the vault, with the Obsidian citations plugin inserting citations as `[[@<citekey>]]` wiki-links in the text (it also maintains `@<citekey>.md` literature notes). For LaTeX submission, pandoc converts the Markdown to TeX — mangling the links into `{[}{[}@key{]}{]}` — and a perl one-liner kept in the vault rewrites them to `\citep{key}`; per-paper `.bib` files carry the same citekeys, and the result is finished in Overleaf. Everything joins on the citekey — bib entry ↔ wiki-link ↔ note filename ↔ `\citep`.

BBT derives citekeys from creators+title+year unless a `Citation Key: <key>` line in the item's `extra` field pins them; unpinned keys silently recompute when those fields change, which is exactly what enrichment does. The support is two generic read-only seams, none Obsidian-specific — zelador never writes pins itself; pinning is done in Zotero via Better BibTeX's own "Pin BibTeX key" (the `pin_citekey` op was built and removed at the user's decision — issue #21, branch `pin-citekey`):

- **Citekey sources (config)** — `citekey_sources` is a list of paths: `.bib` files are parsed for their entry keys; anything else is a file glob whose matches are scanned for citekeys — inline `[[@<citekey>]]` wiki-links in Markdown, `\cite`/`\citep`/`\citet{...}` commands in TeX (comma-separated keys included), and `@<citekey>.md` basenames. This is the only place the workflow enters the tool — any consumer that references items by citekey (pandoc, org-roam, a bare LaTeX repo) plugs in the same way. Unset, everything below is inert.
- **`zel audit citekeys`** — cross-references the sources against the library (audit check 5); its `cited_unpinned` findings are the list to pin in Zotero before an enrichment session.

The Web API never sees unpinned keys, so the configured `.bib` export is the authority for an item's current citekey; bib entries match back to items by DOI, falling back to normalized title+year.

## Architecture decisions

- **Read path** — Zotero Web API (v3) is canonical for reads and writes. The local SQLite replica is a secondary, explicitly-named path (`zel local ...`) for bulk analytics and direct PDF file access only; `zel local` snapshots the database file itself and queries the copy, never the live file. The Zotero data directory is auto-discovered per platform (`~/Zotero` on Linux/macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\Zotero` on Windows, mounted Windows profile under WSL — here `/mnt/c/Users/noah_/Zotero`), overridable in config.
- **Write path** — Web API only; never write to SQLite. Zotero uses optimistic concurrency: every object, and the library as a whole, carries a version counter, and a write conditioned on a stale counter is rejected. Batch item writes carry each item's `data.version` (per-object conflicts arrive in the response's `failed` map) and no library-level `If-Unmodified-Since-Version` — a library-wide header would let any unrelated change 412 the whole batch. The library-level header is used only on endpoints that require it (e.g. the settings endpoint used for `tagColors`), which fail whole-operation.
- **HTTP client** — Hand-rolled thin client on `httpx` (~350 lines), not pyzotero — rationale and revive condition in Discarded ideas. Crib pyzotero's `_client.py` version-header conventions and test suite as reference — pyzotero is Blue Oak 1.0.0 (permissive, MIT-compatible); crib from current releases, not old GPL-era versions.
- **Client musts** — Paginated full-library dump following `Link: next` headers; batch reads of specific items via `itemKey` in 50-key chunks (post-apply verification and undo state-checks fetch exactly the touched items); batch writes — items and collections alike — chunked at 50 parsing the per-object `success`/`unchanged`/`failed` response maps; honor `Backoff`/`Retry-After` including on 200s, with real retry of 429'd requests; an explicit timeout on every request, so a dead socket fails loudly instead of hanging; surface version conflicts per item key; endpoint builder constructs `/users/<ZOTERO_USER_ID>/` paths only — group libraries are unreachable by construction, and setup verifies the key's identity and write access via `/keys/current`; the `Zotero-API-Key` header is redacted from exceptions, traces, and logs — CLI output is agent-read by design, so an unredacted error would leak the key into the agent's context.
- **Auth** — `.env` at repo root: `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_USER_ID=11868292`. Never read back into agent context; consumed by the CLI process only. Default setup has the user write `.env` themselves so the key never enters the chat; a user who prefers convenience may paste the key to the agent to write, accepting that it enters the transcript.
- **Stack** — Python via `uv`; TDD against a mocked httpx transport.

## Safety model (three layers)

1. **Pre-session snapshot** — `zel backup` dumps every item's full JSON, including trashed items (`includeTrashed=1`), plus every collection object and the `tagColors` setting — items alone would lose the tree: item JSON carries collection membership keys, but names and parent links live only on collection objects — to `<data dir>/backups/<timestamp>.jsonl`, one object per line. A conditional GET (`If-Modified-Since-Version` with the last backup's library version) makes it a verified no-op when nothing changed. Each expanded plan records the backup it was validated against plus the library version at validation; `zel apply` requires that exact backup, not merely a recent one. This is the last-resort restore, and restore is a named path, not an idea: `zel debug restore <backup> <key...>` pushes the backed-up JSON of exactly the named objects back through the standard write machinery — deliberately version-unpinned, because last-resort recovery overwrites whatever state the accident left — logged like any session and drilled once in M3b. Routine undo replays the change log (layer 2) instead: Zotero's server keeps no history — item deletions go to a restorable trash, but tag removals and field overwrites are unrecoverable server-side.
2. **Write-ahead change log** — a session is one `zel apply` run of one plan; its log file is named by the plan id. Before each write request, the session log gets a `pending` entry per operation carrying the old state; after the response, each entry is marked `applied`, `unchanged`, or `failed` from the per-object result maps, with the new version. A crash mid-apply therefore never loses the undo record. `zel apply` refuses to start while any session log has unresolved `pending` entries; `zel debug reconcile <session>` clears them deterministically — fetch the touched items, compare against each entry's logged old and new state, and mark it `applied` or `failed` accordingly. `failed` entries end that operation's story — recovery is never an in-place retry but a fresh cycle: carry the failed operations' intents into a new changeset, `zel validate` against the moved library, approve the new plan; plans are never edited by hand. `zel undo <session>` refuses a session whose log still holds `pending` entries (reconcile first), replays only `applied` entries backwards, and before reversing each one verifies the item's current state still equals the logged new state — anything else is reported as an undo conflict and left untouched; reversed entries are marked `undone`, so the log records that outcome too.
3. **Validator hard rules** — no deletions ever, items and collections alike (the agent may only propose trashing — Zotero 7 gave collections a trash of their own — never purge); changesets touching >200 objects refuse to apply without an explicit `--big` flag; writes only to fields the changeset schema allows — `extra` is never a `fill_field` target — it is plugin territory, Better BibTeX pins citekeys there — and `fill_field` targets are checked against the item type's actual fields via the API schema endpoints (`/itemTypeFields`, cached per session) rather than hardcoded lists.

Free fourth layer: the local Windows SQLite replica is itself a full copy sync could restore from.

## Changesets

Changesets are **symbolic intents**, not expanded edits: a closed operation vocabulary — `merge_tag`, `add_tag`, `remove_tag`, `fill_field`, `clear_field`, `set_creators`, `set_item_type`, `create_item`, `add_to_collection`, `remove_from_collection`, `create_collection`, `rename_collection`, `move_collection`, `trash_collection` (propose-only), `trash_item` (propose-only) — defined by a schema in the repo and grown only by editing that schema. `zel validate` expands intents against the live library into an exact per-item plan pinned to item versions; the expanded plan is what the user approves and what `zel apply` executes. Version pins make stale plans fail loudly per item instead of drifting silently.

**Expansion semantics.** Zotero treats `tags` and `collections` as complete arrays — a partial write silently removes whatever it omits. So every tag/collection operation expands by read-modify-write of the full array, and the plan records both old and new arrays per item. Operations compose: when one plan touches the same item more than once (a pin plus field fills, a merge plus an add), expansion coalesces them into a single write object carrying the composed new state — sequential writes to one item would invalidate each other's version pins. Log entries stay per-operation and share their write's resulting version. `merge_tag` rewrites each carrying item's tag array (add canonical, drop aliases, preserve everything else); no global tag delete is needed — a Zotero tag ceases to exist once no item carries it. `create_collection` operations carry a precomputed client-generated object key, so a retried request cannot create a duplicate and undo always knows the key; undoing a `create_collection` trashes the collection by that key, never a hard delete. `rename_collection` and `move_collection` are read-modify-write of the collection object's `name` and `parentCollection`, version-pinned like any write, old and new values in the plan. `trash_item` and `trash_collection` are a PATCH of `deleted: true` — the undo is exactly `deleted: false`; trashed items remain listed under `/items/trash`, and trashing a collection leaves its items and their memberships intact. The correction ops (issue #24) assume nothing about how an item arrived: `clear_field` writes the empty string (which the server stores as field removal — the missing half of `fill_field`, since a wrong value must be removable, not just overwritable); `set_creators` replaces the whole creators array, validated against the item type's creator types; `set_item_type` changes the type and, because the server validates the *merged* object, clears every stored field the new type does not allow in the same write — and refuses when an existing creator type does not fit the new type (`set_creators` first). `create_item` carries a precomputed client-generated key exactly like `create_collection` — idempotent create, undo trashes by that key — validating fields against the item type, tags against the registry (exclusive families included), and collections against the tree; its optional `attachment` selector adopts an existing standalone attachment by writing its `parentItem` in the same plan, which is how a PDF that imported without metadata becomes a real item. Whether a citekey-affecting edit *should* wait for a pin (done in Zotero via BBT) is the session's call, informed by the citekey audit (issues #19, #21).

**Contracts.** Three versioned JSON shapes, defined once as dataclasses + schema in the repo: `changeset.v1` (the intents), `plan.v1` (a header binding the plan to its backup id and validation-time library version; per-item operations each with an operation id, item key, pinned item version, old state, new state, and risk tier; plus the optional `tagColors` settings entry), and `log.v1` (operation id → pending/applied/unchanged/failed/undone + resulting version). Approval in chat is per intent group — a group is one intent together with everything it expanded into — but apply is all-or-nothing per plan: if any group is rejected, the agent trims the changeset and re-validates into a fresh plan — what `zel apply` executes is always the fully-approved plan file, byte-for-byte. Plan ids — and therefore session log names — are `<UTC timestamp>-<slug>`.

Enrichment logic is CLI-side (deterministic, cached, fixture-tested) — the agent's role is judgment: deciding whether a lookup candidate truly matches an item and emitting `fill_field` intents.

## Approval flow

```
agent reads library → proposes changeset (JSON in <data dir>/changesets/)
→ zel validate (against taxonomy.yaml + hard rules)
→ agent renders compact summary in chat, user approves per group
→ zel apply --dry-run (always) → zel apply
→ change log written
```

Risk tiers: filling an empty field is low-risk; overwriting a non-empty field, removing tags, and major moves are high-risk. Every change is approved — tiers set how much scrutiny a group deserves in review, not whether it is reviewed.

## CLI design

- **Framework**: Typer, single console script `zel = "zelador.cli:app"`. Everyday verbs top-level, grouped with `rich_help_panel`; utilities under one nested `zel debug` sub-app. Modern `Annotated[T, typer.Option(...)]` signatures. English commands, kebab-case options, `--flag/--no-flag` booleans, positional argument for the primary subject.
- **Output**: human output on stdout; diagnostics and defaulting notices on stderr (`err=True`). Every read command takes `--json` emitting newline-delimited JSON, one object per line (jq-friendly; the form agents consume); mutating commands take it too, emitting a final outcome object (counts plus per-key failures with the API's code and message) so the agent never parses prose to decide what to do next. A `--verbose` flag traces each request (method, URL, status, version headers — auth redacted), and backoff waits are announced on stderr so honouring `Backoff`/`Retry-After` never looks like a hang. Color respects `NO_COLOR` and disables when piped. Exit codes: 0 success, 1 operational failure, 2 bad input / user abort.
- **Safety idioms**: `--dry-run` on every mutating command printing exactly what would happen; `typer.confirm` gate unless `--yes`; forecast banner (item/request counts) before anything expensive or rate-limited.
- **Docs**: README with aligned command table and copy-pasteable `uv run zel ...` blocks; every command docstring has an Examples block; `CLAUDE.md` carries a "situation X → run command Y" routing table for agent use.
- **Layout**: flat package (`zelador/` at repo root), hatchling, `.env` + committed `.env.example` (and `taxonomy.yaml` + committed `taxonomy.example.yaml`, same pattern), thin Typer bodies over pure functions, `CliRunner` tests asserting exit codes and output. Deliberate deviation from house style: data lives in `platformdirs` user data dir, not in-repo, because this repo is public.

### Command surface

Kept deliberately small: variants of the same operation are flags or subcommand arguments, not new verbs (`zel items <keys>` is the batch read, `--bib` is the bibliography rendering, `fulltext` is a lookup source). Panels are the `rich_help_panel` groups in `--help`.

- **Library**
  - `zel status` — one-screen session orientation, the skills' mandatory opener: live library version (the command's single API request), last backup's timestamp and version (the intake `--since` marker), item/tag counts from the latest backup, unresolved `pending` session logs, latest audit report and its version, and whether `config.yaml`, `taxonomy.yaml`, and `citekey_sources` are configured; `--json`. If the API request fails it prints the local half plus the error — the one named exception to failing loudly, because "API unreachable" is exactly what a session opener must be able to say.
  - `zel items [keys...]` — full paginated dump, or batch read of the given keys; `--since <version>` limits the dump to items added/modified after that library version (Zotero's native `?since=`); `--json` NDJSON; `--bib` (`--style`, APA default) renders bibliography entries server-side (`include=bib`).
  - `zel tags` / `zel collections` — read tag list (with counts and type) / collection tree, `--json`.
  - `zel local <sql>` — read-only analytics: raw agent-authored SQL against a fresh snapshot of Zotero's SQLite. Every run recopies the database with its `-wal`/`-journal` siblings (the desktop writes the live file continuously) and gates on `PRAGMA integrity_check` — a torn copy fails loudly, never answers.
- **Findings**
  - `zel audit [check]` — run all audit checks or one; `--since <version>` scopes findings to items changed after that library version (see Audit); writes JSON per check + `audit-report.md` to the data dir.
  - `zel lookup crossref|arxiv|fulltext` — deterministic enrichment lookups from a named source, cached, candidates with scores; `fulltext <key>` tries server fulltext first, local `pypdf` extraction as fallback; output bounded by default, `--full` returns everything, truncation flagged in `--json`; `--image` renders page one to PNG for visual inspection of scanned PDFs.
- **Change loop**
  - `zel backup` — full-library JSONL snapshot (items, collections, `tagColors`) to the data dir.
  - `zel validate <changeset>` — check symbolic intents against `taxonomy.yaml` + hard rules; expand into a version-pinned per-item plan written to `plans/`.
  - `zel apply <plan>` — execute an expanded plan; `--dry-run` first-class; refuses unless the plan's pinned backup exists; `--big` for >200 items.
  - `zel undo <session>` — replay a session's change log backwards.
- **Utilities**
  - `zel debug ...` — inspection and recovery utilities: config paths, cache state, raw API probe, `whoami` (`/keys/current` identity), `reconcile <session>` (resolve a crashed apply's pending entries), `restore <backup> <key...>` (layer-1 last resort — see Safety model).

Expected use: the agent opens with `zel status`; in a `zelador-review` or `zelador-intake` session it leans on **Library** reads throughout for context (`--json` mode, piped); **Findings** runs early — audit at session start, lookups while drafting enrichment intents; the **Change loop** runs late and in listed order, once per approved plan (`backup` → `validate` → `apply`, with `undo` reserved for regret); **Utilities** only when something misbehaves. Humans run the same commands ad hoc — most often `zel audit` and `zel items --bib` — which is why everything stays top-level rather than nested under sub-apps.

## Data layout

The repo is public. Personal library data never lives inside the working tree — it lives in the platform-native user data directory, resolved via `platformdirs` (`~/.local/share/zelador/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/zelador/` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\zelador\` on Windows), overridable with `ZELADOR_DATA_DIR`:

```
<data dir>/
  backups/     pre-session full-library JSONL snapshots
  audit/       audit output JSON + generated report
  changesets/  proposed changeset JSON files
  plans/       expanded version-pinned plans emitted by `zel validate`
  cache/       lookup response cache (Crossref/arXiv)
  log/         append-only per-session change logs
```

Committed: code, `SPEC.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT — all deps and the pyzotero reference are permissive), `taxonomy.example.yaml` (the starter registry), `config.example.yaml`. Never committed: `.env`, `taxonomy.yaml` (the user's registry — a personal vocabulary), `config.yaml`, any library dumps. A defensive `.gitignore` for `.env`, `taxonomy.yaml`, `config.yaml`, and `data/` exists as a second net regardless.

Non-auth config lives in `config.yaml` at repo root (committed `config.example.yaml`, same pattern as `.env` and `taxonomy.yaml`), capped at three keys until a real session needs a fourth: `zotero_data_dir` (overrides the per-platform auto-discovery), `citekey_sources` (see Downstream reference workflow), and `style` (CSL style, `apa` default). `style` governs rendering defaults — `--bib` and the audit's rendered-entry check — never the metadata-completeness field table, which stays APA-calibrated in code. The zelador data dir itself remains env-only (`ZELADOR_DATA_DIR`).

## Tag taxonomy

Namespaced tags of the form `family:value` (lowercase, hyphens for compound values), controlled by a registry file (`taxonomy.yaml`). The registry declares the allowed families, each family's canonical tags, their meaning, known aliases, and optional colours; the validator only permits tags listed there. The repo commits `taxonomy.example.yaml` — a starter registry carrying the default families and colours — which setup copies to `taxonomy.yaml` for the user to opt into and edit; the live registry is the user's file, never the repo's.

- Initial families: `status:` (workflow state), `topic:` (subject vocabulary). Further families (`rating:` (subjective valuation — fav/core/skip), `method:`, `use:`, ...) are added only if the audit shows a real need – the family list lives in the registry, not in code, and the registry is designed from real audit data (M2), not invented up front.
- Colours: Zotero pins up to 9 coloured tags atop its tag-selector pane and gives them number-key shortcuts — prime UI real estate for workflow tags. A registry entry may declare a colour (hex) and position. Declared colours must come from the Okabe-Ito colourblind-safe palette (ref: jfly.uni-koeln.de/color) — eight colours, comfortably inside Zotero's cap — shipped as one constant beside the validator, which rejects any hex outside it, so no hand-rolled colours. The registry is authoritative for the entire `tagColors` array — the setting is one value, so writing it replaces every assignment, including colours hand-set outside the registry (the plan's old value shows exactly what goes). When registry colours differ from the library setting, `zel validate` adds a library-settings entry (old and new `tagColors` value) to the plan alongside the per-item operations; `zel apply` writes it via the Web API settings endpoint (version-pinned like any write), the change log tracks it, and undo restores the previous value. The validator enforces the 9-tag cap; colours are reserved for workflow families (`status:` and kin), never `topic:`.
- User should disable Zotero's "Automatically tag items with keywords and subject headings" setting so the mess stops growing.

Default colour assignments, shipped in `taxonomy.example.yaml` (Okabe-Ito; the copied registry is the user's file, so changing them is editing one line). Positions double as Zotero's number-key shortcuts, ordered by expected frequency of use. Yellow (`#F0E442`) is deliberately unused — coloured tags render as coloured text in the selector, where yellow is illegible:

- Position 1 — `status:to-read` — `#E69F00` (Okabe-Ito orange)
- Position 2 — `status:read` — `#009E73` (Okabe-Ito bluish green)
- Position 3 — `rating:fav` — `#CC79A7` (Okabe-Ito reddish purple)

Registry shape (`taxonomy.yaml`), kept minimal:

```yaml
families:
  status: {description: workflow state, coloured: true, exclusive: true}
  topic:  {description: subject vocabulary}
tags:
  - tag: status:read
    description: finished reading
    aliases: [read, finished]
    colour: "#009E73"    # optional; Okabe-Ito bluish green; position = order within coloured tags
```

An `exclusive` family allows at most one of its tags per item — `status:to-read` and `status:read` cannot coexist; the validator refuses writes that would violate it, and the conformance audit (check 6) reports the stock's existing violations.

Aliases are the adoption mechanism: a registry tag lists the names a library's pre-existing tags used for the same concept, and approved `merge_tag` changesets fold them into the canonical vocabulary. Aliases are valid as selectors in changeset intents (so `merge_tag` can name what it replaces) but never as proposed output — the validator only ever writes canonical tags. The registry is linted at load, before anything expands against it: a duplicated canonical tag, an alias listed under two tags (it would make `merge_tag` ambiguous), or an alias shadowing a canonical name fails loudly.

## Legacy migration (this library)

One-time mappings for the author's existing tags — a fresh adopter skips this section; the mechanism is just the alias machinery above. The current tag system is otherwise dropped wholesale, not transitioned.

- Old status vocabulary, translated to English: `ler` → `status:to-read`, `lido` → `status:read`, `fav` → `rating:fav` (introducing the `rating:` family — the audit confirms what `fav` actually marked by sampling its carriers). `_tablet` is dropped with the rest, not migrated.
- The ~1,200 auto-imported subject tags (arXiv categories, newspaper sections, publisher keywords) are rewritten against the registry as `topic:` tags, in approved batches (M4).

## Collections philosophy

The starting hypothesis for M5, to be confirmed against M1 audit data — rules normative now, shelf names decided then. Division of labour: **collections are entry points** (projects and browsing shelves), **tags carry the cross-cutting truth** (subject, status). Zotero copies tags with items across libraries but not collection placements — subject knowledge lives portably in `topic:` tags; shelves are disposable views over it.

```
projects/<name>/...        one per active output (papers, the capstone, courses);
                           subcollections mirror the output's own structure (chapters, screening stages)
topics/<area>/<subtopic>   coarse browsing shelves — few areas, at most one subtopic level,
                           matching the shape of today's tree, which M5 maps rather than tears down
archive/<name>/...         finished projects moved here wholesale, reading lists preserved
```

- Depth: `topics/` stops at one subtopic level; only `projects/` earns deeper nesting, and only mirroring its output. Distinctions finer than a subtopic are `topic:` tags, not collections.
- A shelf earns existence when browsing it is useful; a tag earns existence when filtering by it is useful.
- `archive/` takes projects, never items: a finished project's collection moves under `archive/` intact; its items stay live on their shelves and tags.
- Unfiled = untriaged. Zotero's built-in Unfiled Items view is the inbox; intake files each new item onto at least one shelf. Project membership happens when a project actually uses the item, not at intake.
- Dynamic views (`status:to-read` × one `topic:`, say) are desktop saved searches, not more collections — a user habit the spec names, not tool surface (the saved-searches API stays discarded).

The redundancy between shelves and `topic:` tags is accepted, not fought: shelves serve browsing (the tablet especially, where tag filtering is clumsy), tags serve filtering and validation. Intake guards the join for new items; the collection-hygiene audit catches drift in the stock.

## Audit (`zel audit`)

Emits one JSON file per check under `<data dir>/audit/` (machine-readable, diffable between runs) plus a generated `audit-report.md` summary. Each check's JSON is stamped with the library version and timestamp it was computed at — the anchor that makes run-to-run diffs meaningful.

`--since <version>` scopes the findings to items added or modified after that library version — the intake session's default view. Zotero's native `?since=` parameter does the item filtering server-side; checks that need whole-library context to judge an item (duplicates compare against everything, tag mess clusters across the full tag list) still read the full library but report only findings involving in-scope items. The marker is not new state: it is the previous backup's recorded library version, read from `backups/` and surfaced by `zel status`.

1. **Metadata completeness** — per item, missing DOI / date / creators / publication, scored by item type (a webpage legitimately lacks a DOI; a journal article doesn't). Judged against citation needs, not completionism — literally: the audit renders each item's actual bibliography entry server-side (`include=bib` with a CSL `style=`, APA by default — the author's general style) and a visibly broken entry is the finding, alongside the field-level rules. Those live as one data table in code, keyed by Zotero `itemType`: which fields are required, and which field counts as the "publication" (`publicationTitle`, `bookTitle`, `conferenceName`, `publisher`, ...). Requirements are calibrated to what APA 7 asks per type, covering the types the library actually holds — all on top of creators, date, and title: journal articles (`publicationTitle`, volume, issue, pages, DOI); preprints (repository, arXiv id or DOI); books (publisher — APA 7 dropped place); book chapters (`bookTitle`, editors, pages, publisher); conference papers (proceedings name, pages, DOI); newspaper and magazine pieces (publication, exact date); blog posts and webpages (site name, URL, exact date); videos and podcasts (channel or host, platform, URL, date); reports and theses (institution, report number or thesis type). An item whose type has no rule is itself a finding — never silently skipped. The capstone project's BBT-exported `.bib` files are the concrete reference for which fields real citations exercise. Includes standalone attachments: PDFs with no parent item, invisible to bibliographies.
2. **Tag mess** — cluster near-duplicates and case-duplicates (`Artificial Intelligence` / `artificial intelligence` / `AI`, four casings of `machine learning`), separate automatic from manual tags (the API marks tag type).
3. **Collection hygiene** — items in no collection, empty collections, duplicate sibling names (two `Clickbait` under Detection), orphaned subtrees.
4. **Duplicate items** — same DOI or near-identical title+year.
5. **Citekey integrity** (only with `citekey_sources` configured — see Downstream reference workflow) — orphaned citations — citekeys found in a source (wiki-link, `\cite` command, or note filename) that match no bib entry (evidence of past drift) — and cited-but-unpinned items: citekeys present in a source whose item lacks the `Citation Key:` pin, i.e. the set a metadata edit could break.
6. **Registry conformance** (only with `taxonomy.yaml` present) — the steady-state check backing intake's promise: library tags the registry knows neither as canonical nor alias, top-level items carrying no `status:` tag (the tag-side untriaged detector, mirroring Unfiled on the collection side), exclusive-family violations, and drift between registry colours and the library's live `tagColors` (Zotero-side edits would otherwise go unnoticed until the next colour-touching validate).

## Enrichment (missing metadata)

Sources, composable, all proposal-only through the standard changeset flow:

- **Crossref API** (the DOI registry's metadata service; free, keyless) — fill journal/date/pages by DOI; fuzzy title+author match to find missing DOIs.
- **arXiv API** — abstracts and canonical versions for the arXiv-heavy portion.
- **Server fulltext first** — Zotero has already indexed synced PDFs; `GET /items/<key>/fulltext` returns the extracted text in one request. Try this before any local parsing.
- **PDF extraction** (`pypdf`) — text from local PDFs (the ~2 GB Zotero `storage/` folder, reachable from WSL), fallback for orphan attachments and unsynced files only.

Fulltext output is bounded for agent consumption regardless of source: the default is a metadata-sized head (~first page — title, authors, venue, DOI live there); `--full` returns everything. Locally the head is a real `pypdf` page; for server text (one unpaginated string) it is a character-budget equivalent. The `--json` object always states the source (server or local), whether it was truncated, and the page totals, and the local path includes the PDF's on-disk location — so when the head isn't enough, the agent escalates to `--full` or reads the file itself. The cache keeps the full server response; truncation is display-time, so escalating costs no extra request. The last resort is visual: for scanned or garbled PDFs where text extraction yields nothing useful, `--image` renders the first page to a PNG in `cache/` and prints its path for the agent to view directly (via `pypdfium2` — permissively licensed, unlike PyMuPDF's AGPL).

Crossref disagreements with existing metadata (wrong year, mangled authors) are flagged in the audit report only — never auto-fixed.

Lookup caches never expire; `cache/` is pruned by hand (prototype posture).

Enrichment edits exactly the fields Better BibTeX derives citekeys from (creators, title, date) — before an enrichment session touches them, `zel audit citekeys` names the cited-but-unpinned items so the user can pin them in Zotero (BBT's "Pin BibTeX key") first. Advisory by design — issues #19, #21.

## Skills (shipped with the repo)

The repo is public and Claude Code is the intended driver, so the workflows ship as project skills in `.claude/skills/`, written for any user, not just the author.

Every skill opens with a deterministic orientation preamble before proposing anything: `zel status` first — mandatory, common to all — then per-skill context: `zelador-taxonomy` reads the tag-mess audit JSON and the current registry; `zelador-review` and `zelador-intake` read the latest audit report and `taxonomy.yaml`; `zelador-setup` skips what cannot exist yet on first run.

- **`zelador-setup`** — first-run onboarding: create a Zotero API key (zotero.org → Settings → Security → Applications); write `.env` — default flow has the user edit it themselves so the key never enters the chat, pasting it to the agent is an accepted shortcut if the user prefers; discover the user ID — `zel debug whoami`; verify the connection; copy `taxonomy.example.yaml` → `taxonomy.yaml` and walk the user through opting into families, tags, and colours; recommend disabling auto-tagging.
- **`zelador-taxonomy`** — design or revise `taxonomy.yaml` interactively from real audit data — cluster existing tags, propose canonical vocabulary + aliases, record decisions.
- **`zelador-review`** — the full-library session: backup → audit → interpret findings → propose changesets → validate → in-chat approval → dry-run → apply → log. The cleanup campaign's workhorse; after M5, run occasionally as a health check.
- **`zelador-intake`** — the steady-state session: same loop as `zelador-review`, scoped to the delta. `zel status` supplies the marker (the previous backup's library version); `zel backup`, then `zel audit --since <marker>` and `zel items --since <marker>` to triage each new arrival — `status:to-read` plus `topic:` tags from the registry, metadata gaps filled via `zel lookup` — through the standard changeset flow. No new machinery: the skill is a scoping discipline over the same commands.

Skills encode the safety flow so it is followed by construction, not memory.

## Milestones

- **M1** — read client + `zel backup` (incl. trash, collections, `tagColors`) + `zel audit` — tags, metadata, collections, duplicates → JSON + report — plus the `zel local` snapshot machinery (the unsynced annotations live only there).
- **M2** — taxonomy registry (`taxonomy.yaml`) designed together from M1 audit data.
- **M3a** — write machinery — contracts, `zel validate` expansion, `zel apply`, `zel undo` — TDD against mocked transport and golden plan fixtures; no live writes.
- **M3b** — live shakedown: merge obvious case-duplicate tags on a handful of items, then an undo drill and a `zel debug restore` drill on a sacrificial item — both recovery paths proven before anything bigger.
- **M3c** — metadata enrichment (the stated pain: bibliographies): `zel lookup` and the citekey audit (check 5) land here — the audit names cited items to pin (in Zotero) before enrichment touches derived fields.
- **M4** — full tag rewrite against the registry (~1,500 tags → curated vocabulary).
- **M5** — collections restructure, through the same changeset machinery (the collection operations exist for exactly this) — last, because the collection tree is load-bearing for the capstone's LaTeX submissions and restructuring it is a taxonomy conversation.
- **Steady state (after M5)** — cleanup gives way to intake: recurring `zelador-intake` sessions triage what arrived since the last one, keeping new items conformant so the library never needs a second campaign; full `zelador-review` drops to an occasional health check.

Skills land with their first consumer: `zelador-setup` and `zelador-taxonomy` with M2, `zelador-review` with M3b, `zelador-intake` at steady state.

## Discarded ideas

Considered and rejected, with the condition that would revive each:

- **pyzotero adoption** — its batch updates swallow per-object failures and 429s return success without retrying — both on our critical path; 3 of 4 deps dead weight for our subset. *Revive if:* scope grows to attachments/file uploads.
- **Zotero 7 local API (`localhost:23119`)** — read-only mirror of the Web API served by the desktop app — attractive, but unreachable from this WSL setup (binds Windows localhost; NAT mode can't see it), and it requires Zotero running. The SQLite snapshot covers the same ground, including the unsynced annotations (see Library facts). *Revive if:* WSL mirrored networking is enabled and a spike shows it reachable; then `zel local` can share the web client's parsing.
- **Group library support** — personal-library tool; the endpoint builder makes groups unreachable by construction (see Client musts). *Revive if:* a deliberate future group mode, never by accident.
- **`since`-based cached dump refresh** — YAGNI at the current library size (see Library facts) — a full dump is ~20 requests run occasionally; a persistent cache adds invalidation state. Distinct from `--since` scoping on `zel items`/`zel audit` (accepted — see Audit), which passes Zotero's `?since=` straight through per invocation and keeps no state. *Revive if:* dumps become an actual bottleneck.
- **`Zotero-Write-Token` idempotency** — redundant: precomputed client-generated keys already make creates idempotent and give undo the key.
- **`create_note` operation** — was in the vocabulary, but no audit check, skill, or milestone ever proposes a note — surface without a consumer; its idempotent client-key semantics moved to `create_collection` (and later `create_item`, issue #24). *Revive if:* a workflow actually wants to write notes (an annotation-rescue summary, say).
- **Paul Tol palette variants** — three alternate palettes beside Okabe-Ito were configurability no session needs. *Revive if:* Okabe-Ito's hues genuinely fail someone.
- **`--more` fulltext rung** — a middle step (first two pages + last) between the bounded head and `--full`; escalation already costs no extra request, so two rungs plus `--image` cover it. *Revive if:* real sessions show `--full` regularly blowing the context budget.
- **Plan checksums / approval metadata** — prototype posture: the plan file is the approved artifact and is executed byte-for-byte. *Revive if:* multiple approvers or out-of-chat approval flows.
- **Auto-applying low-risk fills** — contradicts the core principle — the user approves every change; no trust mechanism was ever specified. *Revive if:* enrichment runs clean for several sessions and approval fatigue is real.
- **Logging framework, metrics, log rotation** — stderr prose + the change log cover a prototype; the data dir is user-visible and pruned by hand. *Revive if:* the prototype becomes a product.
- **Flat registered tags** — original taxonomy design; superseded by namespaced `family:value` tags with registry-declared colours.
- **Obsidian-side tooling (bib sync, note generation, LaTeX builds)** — Better BibTeX auto-export and the obsidian-citation-plugin already do this; zelador only protects the citekey join they depend on.
- **Configurable citekey scan patterns** — the Markdown wiki-link, TeX `\cite*`, and `.bib` scanners are hardcoded; pattern config is configurability no real session needs. *Revive if:* an adopter's citekey consumer doesn't match the built-in scanners.
- **`pin_citekey` and the cited-but-unpinned validation veto** — both shipped in M3c and were removed at the user's decision: the veto surprised by refusing unrelated title/date fixes (issue #19), and the user doesn't want zelador writing pins at all — BBT's own client UI does that (issue #21; implementation preserved on branch `pin-citekey`). The audit still reports the cited-but-unpinned set. *Revive if:* hand-pinning in Zotero proves too tedious before an enrichment campaign, or an enrichment session actually orphans vault citations.
- **PyPI packaging** — the skills and example-file onboarding are repo-shaped; a bare installed CLI without them defeats the safety design. *Revive if:* the prototype becomes a product with a non-Claude-Code audience.
- **File upload/download, saved searches, `/publications`, OAuth, Atom/export formats, server-side search** — no consumer in any milestone; full-dump-then-filter makes query plumbing pointless surface area. Item creation (issue #24) deliberately stayed metadata-only: the file itself enters through the Zotero client, and `create_item`'s attachment adoption parents what is already there. *Revive if:* a milestone that actually needs one.

## Process

Branch → TDD → `/review` → merge. `uv` for everything. Semantic commits.

## Library facts (as of 2026-07-19 audit snapshot)

2,006 real items; 1,510 tags; sync live to zotero.org (user `noah-art3mis`; user ID in Auth); 1,142 PDF annotations (Dec 2024 – May 2025) exist only locally and never synced — why sync missed them is still to investigate; the rescue design (bake them into derived PDF copies, `zel bake`) is tracked in issue #4; Better BibTeX installed; two group libraries present but out of scope. BBT auto-export is live (`zotero_library.bib`, 1,843 entries, inside the Obsidian vault) and feeds 178 `@citekey.md` literature notes plus inline `[[@citekey]]` citations across the writing notes; zero pinned citekeys library-wide, so every citekey is derived and enrichment-fragile — one orphaned note pair in the vault already evidences drift.
